# friendify :D
Discord bot that converts text into beanie baby font :)

## To run:
Clone repo: 

```git clone https://github.com/kayleenasser/friendify-bot.git```

Go into directory:

```cd friendify-bot/```

You will need to add the file `tokenbot.py` with the variable,
```bot_token = {token to bot}``` to the `\src` directory. 

Create your own, or message me for token if you know me and would like to use it :)
Then run 

```python ./src/main.py```

and enjoy!!

## Commands

- `!help` or `!intro` or `!hi` or `!hello` or `!h`

  -- To say hi to the bot and learn the other commands.

- `!friendify {your message}` or `!f {your message}`

  -- Covert your message to beanie baby font :)

- `!off`

  -- Set bot offline. Will need to restart application to turn back online.
